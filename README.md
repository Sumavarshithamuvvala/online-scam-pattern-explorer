The Online Scam Pattern Explorer is a web-based platform that detects potential online scams using rule-based heuristics, behavioral analysis, and NLP sentiment evaluation. It provides explainable risk scores with category-wise breakdowns and reasons for flagging messages. Users can submit their own verdicts (Scam or Safe), helping to build a custom dataset for future machine learning model training. The platform also includes an interactive scam awareness quiz to educate users and an integrated Google Form for reporting real scams, making it both an educational and practical tool for staying safe online.
