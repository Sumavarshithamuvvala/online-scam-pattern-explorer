The Online Scam Pattern Explorer is a web-based platform that identifies potential online scams using rule-based heuristics, behavioral analysis, and NLP sentiment evaluation. It provides explainable risk scores with category-wise breakdowns and reasons for flagging messages. Users can submit their verdicts (Scam or Safe), which are stored in Firebase Firestore to build a custom dataset, improve detection accuracy, and help upgrade the website over time. The platform also includes an interactive scam awareness quiz and an integrated Google Form for reporting real scams, making it both educational and practical for staying safe online
